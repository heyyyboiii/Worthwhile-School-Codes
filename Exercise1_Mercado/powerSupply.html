            <p>Abbreviated as PS or P/S, a power supply or PSU (power supply unit) is a hardware component of a computer that supplies all other components with power. The power supply converts a 110-115 or 220-230 volt AC (alternating current) into a steady low-voltage DC (direct current) usable by the computer and rated by the number of watts it generates.</p>
            <p>The power supply is located at the back of the computer, usually at the top. However, many more recent tower computer cases house the power supply at the bottom back of the case. In a desktop computer case (all-in-one), the power supply is located at the back left or back right.</p>

            <p >Everything contained in the computer chassis is powered by the power supply. For example, the motherboard, RAM, CPU, hard drive, disc drives, and most video cards (if the computer has one) are all drawing power from the power supply. Any other external devices and peripherals, such as the computer monitor and printer, have a power source or draw power over the data cable like some USB devices.</p>
