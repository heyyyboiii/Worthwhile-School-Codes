            <p>The PCI Express x16 graphics interface (also called PCIe x16) offers increased bandwidth and scalability over the previous AGP8X generation. PCI Express x16 allows up to 4 GB/s of peak bandwidth per direction, and up to 8 GB/s concurrent bandwidth. PCI-Express x16 is used by the Intel 915 and 925 and other chipsets which support PCI-Express.</p>
            <p>The ‘x16 indicates the maximum number of PCI Express lanes supported and thus, the length of the slot. As version 3.0, each lane provides around 1 GB/s of bandwidth so an x16 slot will provide up to ~16 GB/s of peak bandwidth.</p>

            <p >However, some x16 slots can operate at x8, x4 or x1 electrically on some platforms or motherboards due to lack of available lanes. A typical non HEDT/workstation board will usually have two or three PCI Express x16 slots but only the first one operates a x16.</p>
